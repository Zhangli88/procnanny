Description
-----------
procnanny is a process monitoring and cleaning program as required by the Assignemnt #1 of CMPUT 379, Fall 2015 at the University
of Alberta. It monitors the specified processes in the user's space for their execution for a specified amount of real time, and 
if any of them exceeds that period, sends them a SIGKILL. The list of processes in the user's space is retreived using the unix
command "ps -u". If the monitored process dies on its own before specified time, procnanny does nothing.

Making
------
cd into the directory and run "make" to compile. Run "make clean" to delete the executable. An executable named "procnanny" would
be put in the directory.

NOTE: Please put the "memwatch.h" and "memwatch.c" into the directory before compiling the code. 

Running
-------
Run the executable "procnanny" generated by the "make" command. procnanny takes a command line parameter which is the path of the
config file. So if the config file is located at "/tmp/config", then run "procnanny /tmp/config". Note that the path can also be
a relative path; the path will be computed with respect to the executable's directory. The format of the config file should be
identical to the assignment's requirements: line 1 should be a postive number representing the max allowed duration in seconds 
the processes are allowed to run, and all subsequent lines should be the process names to be monitored.

Note that the process names should be EXACTLY identical to their names in the "COMMAND" column when "ps -u" is run. Partially
matching names will not be monitored. For example, if the process to be monitored is "a.out", ensure the config lists "a.out", 
and not "./a.out" or a variant, and vice versa.

Ensure that the shell has an environment variable "PROCNANNYLOGS configured. This variable should point to a log file that will
be used by procnanny. All the logs will be appended at the end of the file.
